Bursts out listings from Cyber System Printer

Individual files in dated directories.

Overwrite, Skip, Exclude, etc..
Output in text, postcript, pdf...

Initial will be text-only, adding PS and PDF when I get rid of some square tuits and get a round one.  I need text at the moment, cutting and pasting from the one listing file is a total PITA.
